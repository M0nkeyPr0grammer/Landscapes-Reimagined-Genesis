      "The Ancient Temple consists of various Deepslate and Sculk Stone blocks. The temple has 3 levels, an entrance level, top level, and bottom level. The bottom level is hidden and can be accessed by breaking through the 2x2 area of water in the center of the entrance level. Each level generates with Ancient Vases and Chests full of Enchanted Books, Diamond Gear, Echo Shards, and more valuable loot (Full loot tables available soon). The bottom level of the Ancient Temple is littered with Sculk Stone Diamond Ore and various other treasures. There are 2 caged up cells on either side of the bottom level, inside these cells there are Skeleton Skulls. In 1 of the cells there is a chest that contains Cobwebs and the extremely rare Sculk Transmitter."
